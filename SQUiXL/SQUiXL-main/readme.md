Hey, congratulations, you got yourself a SQUiXL!

In this repository, you'll find an examples folder with an assortment of SQUiXL example projects for Arduino, PlatformIO, and MicroPython.

This repositry is a work in progress. Current examples may be updated, and new examples may be added over time.

## MicroPython Support
You'll also find a firmware folder with the latest SQUiXL MicroPython firmware and supporting files. Once MicroPython development for SQUiXL reaches a stable release state, I'll raise a PR for inclusion in the main MicroPython repository.

Until then, this is where you find the latest MicroPython support.

## Official Shipping Firmware
The official SQUiXL shipping firmware has moved to a [new home](https://github.com/UnexpectedMaker/SQUiXL-DevOS).
