# SQUiXL LGVL Example

This example project is designed to help get you started if you are wanting to use LVGL with your SQUiXL.

It initialises the display and touch interface, as well as included peripherals, and creates some UI elements that you can interact with.

Sure, it's a basic example, but it's all you need to get you going.

For more information on using LVGL, please visit the [LVGL website](https://lvgl.io). 


## Thanks
I want to thank Larry Bank for his work on BB_LCD_SPI and BB_LVGL libraries that are used to get all of this going.

Please check out all of Larry's [amazing work](https://github.com/bitbank2/).
