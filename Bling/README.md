# Unexpected Maker - Bling! Micropython

Bling! features an 8 x 40 RGB LED array that can be controlled using the micropython(MP) NeoPixel 
class included with the standard MP build. The basic Bling! board includes an ESP32 S3 mcu and a lot
of other goodies. [See Unexpected Maker's Bling! webpage for details.](https://unexpectedmaker.com/shop.html#!/BLING/p/596946493// "Bling! Webpage")
There is also an excellent [bling github repository](https://github.com/UnexpectedMaker/bling) which includes
a wealth of information including schematics.

The micropython [Unexpected Maker Tiny S3 micropython build](https://micropython.org/download/UM_TINYS3/) has been 
used for development.
